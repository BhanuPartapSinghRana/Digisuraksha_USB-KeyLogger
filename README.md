# USB Keylogger – Internship Project

This repository contains my internship project at Digisuraksha Foundation, where I explored the concept of USB Keyloggers as part of hardware-level cybersecurity research. The project aims to raise awareness about how these devices work, their use cases, risks, and how organizations can defend against them.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is created purely for educational and ethical purposes. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal.

## 📖 About the Project

A USB Keylogger is a small hardware device that connects between a keyboard and a computer to capture keystrokes. It is often used for:

- Penetration testing
- Security awareness training
- Forensic investigations
- My project focused on studying and documenting:
- History of USB Keyloggers
- Description & working principle
- Key features
- Use cases & best-case scenarios
- Flaws & risks
- Ethical benefits for security research

## ✨ Key Features of a USB Keylogger

- Plug-and-play operation
- Stealth mode (undetectable by most antivirus software)
- Large data storage capacity
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Time-stamped logging
- Remote access (in advanced versions)

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand hardware-based threats in cybersecurity
- To demonstrate awareness and preventive measures
- To contribute to cybersecurity education and research

## 📌 Best Case Scenarios
- Penetration testing (authorized environments)
- Cybersecurity training labs
- Digital forensics investigations
- Awareness campaigns for hardware-level threats

##⚡ Flaws & Limitations
- Requires physical access to the target device
- Limited storage capacity
- Can be misused for malicious purposes
- Legal and ethical concerns without consent

## ✅ Positive Takeaways
- Effective tool for cyber awareness
- Encourages organizations to implement stronger endpoint protection
- Useful in security training & ethical hacking exercises
- Demonstrates importance of physical security in cybersecurity

## 📚 Summary

- This project highlights that cybersecurity is not only about software defenses like firewalls and antiviruses, but also about addressing hardware-level vulnerabilities that are often ignored. USB Keyloggers serve as a reminder that awareness + prevention = stronger security.
